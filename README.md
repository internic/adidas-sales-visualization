## Introduction
Welcome to the Data Visualization project built with Django. This project aims to provide insights into the `data_sales.xlsx` dataset using various visualizations implemented in a Django dashboard.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd adidas-sales-visualization
    ```
3. Create virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
4. Activate the environment:
    Windows:
    ```bash
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
    macOS/linux
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
5. Install the required dependencies using the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
6. Run the Django development server:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```


## Project Description
1. **Understand Your Data**
    - **First Step:** Open the `data_sales.xlsx` dataset and familiarize yourself with its structure and the variables mentioned in the guidelines.
    - **Preparing Your Data**

2. **Choosing Your Visualizations**
    - **Retailer Analysis:** Use bar charts to compare the total sales and operating profit by retailer.
    - **Trends:** Utilize line graphs to display trends over time for variables such as `Total Sales` and `Units Sold`.
    - **Geographical Insights:** Employ maps or choropleth maps to visualize sales by region or state.
    - **Product Analysis:** Pie charts or bar charts can be useful to show the distribution of sales among different products.
    - **Price Analysis:** Scatter plots might help in understanding the relationship between `Price per Unit` and `Units Sold` or `Total Sales`.
    - **Sales Method Analysis:** Use pie charts or bar charts to visualize the distribution of sales by different sales methods.
    - **Additional Insights:** For other variables, use appropriate charts accordingly.

3. **Implementing Design Elements**
    - **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent color scheme and style across all your visualizations.
    - **Readability:** Ensure your charts are easily readable, with clear labels, legends, and titles.
    - **Highlight Key Insights:** Use annotations, highlighting, or other visual cues to draw attention to the most important findings.

4. **Creating the Visualizations**
    - **Software and Tools:** Depending on your preference, use software such as Excel, Python with libraries (e.g., matplotlib, seaborn, pandas), or R/RStudio for creating your visualizations.

5. **Analyzing and Reporting**
    - **Analysis:** For each visualization, provide a brief analysis of what the data shows.
    - **Insights:** Summarize the key insights from your analysis and consider the implications on Adidas's sales strategy and operations.
